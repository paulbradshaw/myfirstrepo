# My lovely project about whistles 

This is for my MED7126 project

To make text bold **put two asterisks before and after (with no spaces), like this**

* This is a bullet list
* This is the second item in the list

*One asterisk makes text italic*

***Three asterisks makes text bold AND italic***

[links can be made by putting the link text in square brackets, and then the URL in normal brackets after](http://bbc.co.uk)
